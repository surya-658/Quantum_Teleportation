The concpet is simple but furturistic 

In the coming future when quantum technologie evolve all the quantum machine might not have the capability to perfrom quantum simulations
Some quantum machine might be good at encoding the classical data into quantum circuits while some machine might be good at perfroming quantum simulations 
In such secenarios where two or more quantum machines have to work on a single task we can use this concept of teleportation we can actually teleport across quantum machine 
So what I have done is simple took a Quantum Support Vector machine tried teleporting the qubits encoded by the feature to the quantum kernel which is situated at the lower part of the quantum circuit 
And it worked 
For  this experiment I used the MNIST digits dataset with a total of 150 samples (100 for training, 50 for testing). 

After applying PCA (3 components), the classical data was encoded into quantum states using a feature map.

From there, I implemented multi-qubit quantum teleportation to directly move these encoded qubits into a separate quantum kernel block lower in the circuit.

This kernel was then used to train a Quantum SVM.

Dataset size: 150 samples 
PCA components : 3 
Teleportation : multiqubit teleportation 
Model : Quantum Support Vector Machine 
Train / test split : 100 / 50 
Accuracy : 50 %

As expected, teleportation didn’t improve the accuracy — that wasn’t the goal. The goal was to check weather the teleportation implemented Quantum Support Vector Machine can function end to end and it dose .

This experiment although performed using small sample size and fewer PCA components sheds light on distributed quantum machine learning where multiple quantum devices may handle different stages of a pipeline .
